The things of nothing, Here's where we begin<br/>
The past and present, To be continued<br/>
Stepped up to each plus, Unknowingly<br/>
To be the same, one upon another<br/>
<br/>
Write your name on the top<br/>
Tie the strings so tightly<br/>
Again and again, repeatedly<br/>
Decorate on white wall, to prepare to coming<br/>
The smells of a taste of the great song<br/>
<br/>
Walk on the street to the red on top<br/>
with the rhythm for the good arm swinging<br/>
til the end of the next step by step<br/>
Don't be a shy to a first experience<br/>
<br/>
We are in a room with a round table<br/>
Think about tall trees live near clearwater<br/>
Powerful, Energetic, Healthy, Unity<br/>
Pehu is a sign for pal up with you<br/>
